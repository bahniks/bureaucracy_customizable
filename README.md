# Overview
The software can be used to administer a task used to model the decision to take a bribe in the laboratory developed by [Vranka and Bahník (2018)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01511/full) and [Bahník and Vranka (in press)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804321001531). In the task, participants are asked to sort objects according to a given rule with a small fixed monetary reward for each sorted object. Randomly selected objects are associated with an additional reward (simulating a “bribe”),that participants can get for breaking the sorting rule, which also causes monetary harm to a third party (a charity). The software is easily adjustable without programming knowledge to give a possibility of a wide range of different experimental manipulations, such as manipulation of offered bribes sizes, the probability of bribes, the size and probability of taking a bribe, etc.
 
 # Using the software
 The software requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) to run. Python 3 is free and runs on various operation systems.  
 To use the software, download Python (install Tkinter, Tcl/Tk, which is offered by default).  
 Download the software.   
 To adjust the task, create experimental manipulations, change instructions etc., go to the folder *Stuff* and open file *settings.py* using a code or text editor (for example IDLE installed with Python, but Notepad also works).  
 To run the task, run *experiment.pyw*.  

 # Data
 Data save to folder *Data*.  
 You can extract the data to a long format by running *extract_data.pyw*.  
 It is also possible to extract data from multiple data folder this was (e.g. from folder from different stations).
